---
## sj-tig

* I finally have time to work on this few weeks ago
* wanted to build a useful tool for myself 
* a homage to tig - ncurses UI git tool

---
##  Choosing an API

* js-git under active development
* much more "powerful" - completely modular
* supports any storage backend, transport agnostic
* I was already "invested" in time & backed both rounds
* BUT...
---
## Choosing git-html5

when I actually tried using js-git I found...

* hard to understand the "simple streams" API
* lots of code-churn, re-writes and bit rot
* no working example to start from that was up-to-date
* not much docs (though lots of support from Tim on irc!)
---
## Now...

* sj-tig release 0.1 published in chrome store
* submitting PRs upstream to git-html5 
* YES! can clone & browse commit log :-)
* but also features: open cgit-cloned repo, show commit diffs
---
## DEMO !

---
## (sj-tig) Coming Soon...

Bugfixes!! and git ...

* show **Any** tree
* diff, patch apply/export
* branch
* index (stage commits properly!)
* pull, push
* clone --recursive
* rebase
* MERGING <- aka Holy Grail !!
---
